1. **[Sentiment Classification](https://github.com/piyush41/Sentiment-Classification)**:- study the use of different pre-trained word embeddings (word2vec/GloVe/fastText) for text representation and use them for text classification.
2. **[Question-Answering-System](https://github.com/piyush41/Question-Answering-System)**:- Implement Q&A architecture called QANet. Its encoder consists exclusively of convolution and self-attention.
3. **[MiniGPT](https://github.com/piyush41/MiniGPT)**:- A PyTorch re-implementation of GPT, both training and inference. The simplest, fastest repository for training/finetuning medium-sized GPTs.
